How does the HeadFirst code print the data about the top level menu which gets iterated?
Answer: The MenuComponent base abstract class has a print method, which Menu implements by first printing
its only name. Then iterating over its children:

class Menu {
// snip..
	public void print() 
        {
		System.out.print("\n" + getName());
		System.out.println(", " + getDescription());
		System.out.println("---------------------");
  
		Iterator iterator = menuComponents.iterator();
		while (iterator.hasNext()) {
			MenuComponent menuComponent = 
				(MenuComponent)iterator.next();
			menuComponent.print();
		}
	}
} // end class

2. Implement the protected setPath(std::string) methods in File and Directory.

  dir1.add(file1) 

  is called the path of dir1 is insert into file1, and when 

  dir_top.add(dir_lower)

  is called the path is likewise set.

  Directory::add(Node *pNode)
  {

   // current code
    string path = getName->() + string("/");
    pNode->setPath(this->getName());
  }

  setPath would be protected, but Directory would be a friend of File and could therefore set it. The default path for a new Directory would be "./".

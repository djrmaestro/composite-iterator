Implement getChild(int) and implement find() using iterators?

Use managed pointers instead of raw Node *. I believe the nodeList should hold shared_ptr and Node method should return a weak_ptr.

Implement mkdir and find. find() only searches the immediate children.nd returns 0 otherwise.


find() takes a Node *. If the client tries to add a subdir to a File, Node:getChild, which it inherits, will throw an exception.

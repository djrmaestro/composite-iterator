1. set pCurrent at the appropriate places.
   a. In ctor
   b. operator++

2. Have operator== simply check whether

   if (&directory == &rhs.directory && pCurrent == rhs.pCurrent) {

      return true;
   } else {

      return false;
   }   

3. implement default ctor (only if need) and rewrite end() so that pCurrent = 0 and stack is empty.
   This may require directory to be changed to a pointer.
